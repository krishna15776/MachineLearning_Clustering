Import required Libraries such as Matplotlib for plotting and seaborn for statistics plots and also scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
After importing dataset fit the data into clustering model and predict the future values

Defining clustering method using Expectation-Maximization method
Example: Using Kmeans algorithm on Digits.
